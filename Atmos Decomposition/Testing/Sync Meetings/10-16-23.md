# Minutes/ToDos
- Possibly use Terratest to run unit tests against components
- Possibly use helm-unittest to unit test components
-  Look into Helm dependency example unit test with Terratest
- Create a branch in latest decomposition repo to work against
-  Possible use HelmRelease to generate template template and test against this
- Focus on Atmos core and helm chart
- @Me look into contract testing helm charts
- We'll meet on Thursdays to pair and sync up


# My Questions
 
 - Should the addons be wrapped in a helm chart? 
	 - We will not focus on this as a part as of right now. We will only focus on testing the core components.
